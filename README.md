# Pandas for Data Analysis

This repository is created to document my learning journey with **Pandas**, a Python library used for data analysis and manipulation.

## About the Repository

Currently, this repository contains a single program that focuses on the **basics of Pandas**, specifically:

- Indexing DataFrames and Series  
- Selecting rows and columns  
- Basic data manipulation operations  
- Understanding how Pandas handles structured data  

This serves as a foundation for working with datasets efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  

## Current Progress

- Implemented basic indexing techniques  
- Performed simple data selection and manipulation  

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice Pandas concepts hands-on  
- Build a strong foundation for data analysis  
- Maintain a reference for learned topics  

## Future Scope

More programs will be added as I continue learning advanced Pandas concepts such as:
- Data cleaning  
- Handling missing values  
- Grouping and aggregation  
- Working with real-world datasets  

## Conclusion

This repository represents the initial step in learning data analysis using Pandas. It will be continuously updated as new concepts are explored and implemented.
